# CBIR
**Homework 1: Content-Based Image Retrieval**

Goal: develop a basic CBIR system or utilize an open source library to build a CBIR system



Requirements: 

1. Write programs that can achieve CBIR (you can use open-source library to extract features and calculate distance)

2. Write a report that describes: 
  * How to run your program
  * What kinds of features, distance metrics, and algorithms you used or compared.
  * Detection performance in precision and recall, or even ROC/PR curves

3. Use the four query images in the "_query" directory as the queries, and search for relevant images from all other directories.
